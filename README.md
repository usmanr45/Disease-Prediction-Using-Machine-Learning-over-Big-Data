# DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING OVER BIG DATA

# **Introduction**

The application of machine learning in the field of medical diagnosis is increasing gradually. This can be contributed primarily to the improvement in the classification and recognition systems used in disease diagnosis which is able to provide data that aids medical experts in early detection of fatal diseases and therefore, increase the survival rate of patients significantly.
With big data growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care, and community services.
Using appropriate machine learning algorithms, data mining techniques and big data concept of considering structured as well as unstructured data, we can predict the risk of a chronic diseases along with diagnostic model more accurately.

# **Problem Statement**

Poor clinical decisions can lead to disastrous consequences which are therefore unacceptable. 
Healthcare sector is a major concern in todays world and chronic diseases are contributing to the death caused due to diseases.

# **Objectives**

To analyse the accurate medical data of different chronic disease.
To predict early disease detection.
 Analysis of the Existing algorithm of  DT, CNN-UDRP etc for the different chronic disease.

# **Requirement Analysis*

## **Dataset collection**
For the prediction of chronic diseases, we require large amount of dataset, that will able to calculate the causes for the diseases and to predict the next form of diseases. By collecting the data from various hospitals, dataset is created to predict the diseases
.
## **Analysis of algorithm**
Based on the different chronic diseases, convolution neural network based multimodal and unimodal disease risk prediction (CNN-MDRP&CNN-UDRP) algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital, is used.

## **Conclusion**

The CNN-MDRP  model help us to consider both structured data and unstructured data due to which we can produce more accurate risk-prediction and better patient care.
The algorithms used such as KNN, NB,DT,CNN-MDRP,CNN-UDRP  produces a effective diagnostic model for the prediction of the chronic disease .
The various other classification algorithms used helps in the comparative prediction of the disease.
